		<section class="body-text">The goal of this project is to create a flying testbed that can be easily and cheaply produced with minimal experience. The testbed should be easy to fly, must be autonomous, and must be capable of transmitting imagery back to a ground station. Additionally, it must be able to communicate with a second UAV to distribute tasking and allow for more reliable relaying of imagery to a ground station.</section>

			<div class="beside-image-text">With the need for a more bespoke solution to the durability problem evident, I designed a larger flying wing from scratch using Fusion360. I 3D printed the wing in Bambu Labs' ASA Aero, then coated with fiberglass and epoxy to vastly increase it's strength.</div>
